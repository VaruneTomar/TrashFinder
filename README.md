# TrashFinder

## Overview

TrashFinder is an app designed to address the challenge of finding public trash bins, particularly inspired by experiences in Tokyo, Japan. The app relies on community contributions to map trash bin locations, providing users with a convenient tool to locate bins and get directions via popular map services.

## Project Description

The app features a user-friendly interface with key functionalities:

- **Login Screen:** Utilizes Firebase for Google sign-in (for learning purposes, may not be in the final app).
- **Map & List View:** Displays trash bin locations on an interactive map and in a list format, arranged by distance filters.
- **Directions:** Users can click on a marker to get directions via Google Maps or Apple Maps.
- **Bin Addition:** Users can contribute by adding bins, providing a description and confirming bin presence.
- **Community-Driven:** Relies on user contributions to enhance the app's utility over time.
- **Reporting:** Users can report wrongly added bins, subject to further review and removal.
